Hi, I'm Katherine Furman, but you can call me Katie, everyone else does. 

I'm currently a first-year student in the Neuroscience Graduate Program at the University of Michigan. I'm currently completing my first-year lab rotations, but my research interest is in the neural circuitry of motivation and reward.
