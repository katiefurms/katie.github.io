Hi, I'm Katherine Furman, but you can call me Katie, everyone else does. 

I grew up in central New Jersey, and received my B.S. in Neural Science from New York University in 2019, where I completed my undergraduate honors thesis work with [Dr. Robert Froemke](www.http://froemkelab.med.nyu.edu/). During my time at NYU I was a research fellow of the NIH Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Experiences [(BP-ENDURE)](www.bpendure.org), which funded my academic year and summer-term research. Now, as a graduate student in the [Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://neuroscience.med.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, I'm currently completing my first-year lab rotations, but my research interest is in the neural circuitry of motivation and reward.

Thanks for visiting my website! But bear with me, as it is still under construction.
