Hi, I'm Katherine Furman, but you can call me Katie, everyone else does. 

I grew up in central New Jersey, and received my B.S. in Neural Science from New York University in 2019, where I completed my undergraduate honors thesis work with [Dr. Robert Froemke](www.http://froemkelab.med.nyu.edu/). During my time at NYU I was a research fellow of the NIH Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Experiences [(BP-ENDURE)](www.bpendure.org), which funded my academic year and summer-term research. I am now a PhD Candidate in the laboratory of [Dr. Christian Burgess](https://www.burgesslab.org/) in the [Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://neuroscience.med.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan. In the Burgess lab, my interest is in Melanin-Concentrating Hormone (MCH) neurons in the Lateral Hypothalamus, and how they are involved with motivational aspects of consummatory behaviors. I develop high throughput behavioral setups which I use in combination with optogenetics and fiber photometry in order to study the effects of MCH neuron activation/inhibition on food consumption. I also write a lot of code. 

Outside of the lab, I'm probably playing with my dog, watching reality TV, or trying to find a good bagel.

Thanks for visiting my website! But bear with me, as it is still under construction.
