Hi, I'm Katherine Furman, but you can call me Katie, everyone else does. 

I grew up in central New Jersey, and received my B.S. in Neural Science from New York University in 2019, where I completed my undergraduate honors thesis work with [Dr. Robert Froemke](www.http://froemkelab.med.nyu.edu/). During my time at NYU I was a research fellow of the NIH Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Experiences [(BP-ENDURE)](www.bpendure.org), which funded my academic year and summer-term research. Now, as a graduate student in the [Neuroscience Graduate Program](https://neuroscience.med.umich.edu/) at the University of Michigan, I'm currently completing my first-year lab rotations, but my research interest is in the neural circuitry of motivation and reward.
