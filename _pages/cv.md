Education
======
* Ph.D in Neuroscience, University of Michigan, 2024 (expected)
* Bachelor's of Science in Neural Science, New York University, 2019
  * Honors Thesis: *“Assessing behavioral relevance of pup ultrasonic vocalizations as a function of maternal experience”* Advisor: Robert Froemke, PhD
* Associate's of Science in General Sciences, Raritan Valley Community College, 2015

Research Experience
======
* January 2018 - May 2019: *BP-ENDURE Research Fellow, NYU Skirball Institute for Biomolecular Medicine*
  * Laboratory of Dr. Robert Froemke, PhD
  * Senior thesis project used a Conditioned Place-Preference paradigm to assess the preference of female mice for infant-related auditory cues, including pup ultrasonic vocalizations, dependent on maternal experience
  * Funded by NIH Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Experiences  & NYU Dean’s Undergraduate Research Fund

* Summer 2018: *BP-ENDURE Research Fellow, Yale University Dept. of Psychiatry*
  * Laboratory of Dr. Marina Picciotto, PhD
  * Used fiber photometry to measure effects of cholinergic systems on inhibitory neuron activity in subtypes of interneurons in the basolateral amygdala of mice during stress-related behaviors
  * Funded by NIH Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Experiences (BP-ENDURE)
  
* Summer 2017: *BP-ENDURE Research Fellow, University of Michigan Molecular & Behavioral Neuroscience Institute*
  * Laboratory of Dr. Jill B. Becker, PhD
  * Used Fast-Scan Cyclic Voltammetry in anaesthetized rats to investigate sex-differences in selective estrogen receptor subtype involvement in cocaine-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens 
  * Funded by NIH Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Experiences (BP-ENDURE)

* January 2016 - December 2017: *Student Research Assistant, NYU Center for Neural Science*
  * Laboratory of Dr. Cristina Alberini, PhD
  * Main project involved characterizing expression of insulin-like growth factor II mRNA through in-situ hybridization, with the goal of understanding mechanisms by which it promotes memory consolidation
  * Subprojects include extensive use of Neurolucida360 to analyze dendritic spine density of hippocampal cell cultures
